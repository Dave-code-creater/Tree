## Overview
Binary Search Tree Functions in C offers a set of functions to facilitate working with binary search trees. It includes functions for creating nodes, inserting values to maintain the BST property, printing the tree structure, and deleting the entire tree. Whether you're learning about binary trees or incorporating them into a larger project, this program provides essential tools for working with BSTs in the C language.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

- **C Compiler:** A C compiler, such as GCC, compatible with your operating system.

- **Text Editor or IDE:** A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for editing and managing your C code.

- **Operating System Compatibility:** Ensure that your chosen development environment and C compiler are compatible with your operating system.

- **Standard C Library:** Standard C library functions are typically included with most C compilers.

## Usage

1. Clone the Repository:**
